# Spotilist

## Introduction
A direct way to be featured in a Spotify playlist is to contact the curator directly. If you are not yet famous, you may want to restrict yourself to playlists that:

- Cover your genre;
- Include emerging artists.

The purpose of this app is to find, amongst all the Spotify playlists, those that meet your search criteria (i.e., your query).

## How it works
The app works like this: you are asked to enter a query for your search. This should contain a description of the type of playlist you are looking for. For example, '*modern progressive rock*'.

In addition, you will have to enter the total number of playlists to be displayed and the curators to be excluded.

This is to avoid considering curators who are too famous and whom you cannot reasonably address.

Finally, you might want to exclude playlists whose least famous artist has more than a certain number of followers. To do so, adjust the the 'Maximum number of followers' parameter.

## Deployment

The app is currently deployed on **Streamlit**, and is accessible at https://giacomopiccinini-spotilist-app-d9om9j.streamlit.app/. Notice: it has definitely not been tested (carefully enough) yet, so I do expect lots of bugs. If you find any, please do get in touch with me!
